## Kubeflow

The Kubeflow project is dedicated to making deployments of machine learning (ML) workflows on Kubernetes simple, portable and scalable.
Our goal is not to recreate other services, but to provide a straightforward way to deploy best-of-breed open-source systems for ML to diverse infrastructures.
Anywhere you are running Kubernetes, you should be able to run Kubeflow.

### Architecture

The following diagram shows Kubeflow as a platform for arranging the components of your ML system on top of Kubernetes:

Kubeflow builds on Kubernetes as a system for deploying, scaling, and managing complex systems.

### ML Workflow

When you develop and deploy an ML system, the ML workflow typically consists of several stages.
Developing an ML system is an iterative process.
You need to evaluate the output of various stages of the ML workflow, and apply changes to the model and parameters when necessary to ensure the model keeps producing the results you need.

For the sake of simplicity, the following diagram shows the workflow stages in sequence.
The arrow at the end of the workflow points back into the flow to indicate the iterative nature of the process:

In the experimental phase, you develop your model based on initial assumptions, and test and update the model iteratively to produce the results you’re looking for:

- Identify the problem you want the ML system to solve.
- Collect and analyze the data you need to train your ML model.
- Choose an ML framework and algorithm, and code the initial version of your model.
- Experiment with the data and with training your model.
- Tune the model hyperparameters to ensure the most efficient processing and the most accurate results possible.

In the production phase, you deploy a system that performs the following processes:

- Transform the data into the format that your training system needs. To ensure that your model behaves consistently during training and prediction, the transformation process must be the same in the experimental and production phases.
- Train the ML model.
- Serve the model for online prediction or for running in batch mode.
- Monitor the model’s performance, and feed the results into your processes for tuning or retraining the model.

### Kubeflow components in the ML workflow

The next diagram adds Kubeflow to the workflow, showing which Kubeflow components are useful at each stage:
