## Container Orchestrators

Container orchestration automates and simplifies provisioning, and deployment and management of containerized applications.

Today, Kubernetes is the most popular container orchestration platform, and most leading public cloud providers - including Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform, IBM Cloud and Microsoft Azure - offer managed Kubernetes services.
Other container orchestration tools include Docker Swarm and Apache Mesos.

Because containers are smaller, more resource-efficient and more portable than virtual machines (VMs), containers - and more specifically, containerized microservices or serverless functions - have become the de facto compute units of modern cloud-native applications.

In small numbers, containers are easy enough to deploy and manage manually.
But in most organizations the number of containerized applications is growing rapidly, and managing them at scale is impossible without automation.

Enter container orchestration, which automates the operations tasks around deploying and running containerized applications and services.

Most container orchestration tools support a declarative configuration model: A developer writes a configuration file (in YAML or JSON depending on the tool) that defines a desired configuration state, and the orchestration tool runs the file uses its own intelligence to achieve that state.

The orchestration tool schedules deployment of the containers (and replicas of the containers, for resiliency) to a host, choosing the best host based on available CPU capacity, memory, or other requirements or constraints specified in the configuration file.

The chief benefit of container orchestration is automation.

## Kubernetes

Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation. It has a large, rapidly growing ecosystem. Kubernetes services, support, and tools are widely available.

The name Kubernetes originates from Greek, meaning helmsman or pilot.
K8s as an abbreviation results from counting the eight letters between the "K" and the "s".

### Why you need Kubernetes and what it can do

Kubernetes provides you with a framework to run distributed systems resiliently. It takes care of scaling and failover for your application, provides deployment patterns, and more.

Kubernetes provides you with:

- **Service discovery** and **load balancing**: Kubernetes can expose a container using the DNS name or using their own IP address. If traffic to a container is high, Kubernetes is able to load balance and distribute the network traffic so that the deployment is stable.
- **Storage orchestration**: Kubernetes allows you to automatically mount a storage system of your choice, such as local storages, public cloud providers, and more.
- **Automated rollouts** and **rollbacks**: You can describe the desired state for your deployed containers using Kubernetes, and it can change the actual state to the desired state at a controlled rate. For example, you can automate Kubernetes to create new containers for your deployment, remove existing containers and adopt all their resources to the new container.
- **Automatic bin packing**: You provide Kubernetes with a cluster of nodes that it can use to run containerized tasks. You tell Kubernetes how much CPU and memory (RAM) each container needs. Kubernetes can fit containers onto your nodes to make the best use of your resources.
- **Self-healing**: Kubernetes restarts containers that fail, replaces containers, kills containers that don't respond to your user-defined health check, and doesn't advertise them to clients until they are ready to serve.
- **Secret and configuration management**: Kubernetes lets you store and manage sensitive information, such as passwords, OAuth tokens, and SSH keys. You can deploy and update secrets and application configuration without rebuilding your container images, and without exposing secrets in your stack configuration
