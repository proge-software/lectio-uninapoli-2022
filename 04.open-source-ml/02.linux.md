## Operating System Basics

An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs.

For hardware functions such as input and output and memory allocation, the operating system acts as an intermediary between programs and the computer hardware, although the application code is usually executed directly by the hardware and frequently makes system calls to an OS function or is interrupted by it.

## Linux Distribution

A Linux distribution (often abbreviated as distro) is an operating system made from a software collection that includes the Linux kernel and, often, a package management system.

A typical Linux distribution comprises a Linux kernel, GNU tools and libraries, additional software, documentation, a window system (the most common being the X Window System, or, more recently, Wayland), a window manager, and a desktop environment.

A Linux distribution may also be described as a particular assortment of application and utility software (various GNU tools and libraries, for example), packaged with the Linux kernel in such a way that its capabilities meet many users' needs.

### Linux Kernel

The Linux kernel is a free and open-source, monolithic, modular, multitasking, Unix-like operating system kernel. It was originally authored in 1991 by Linus Torvalds for his i386-based PC, and it was soon adopted as the kernel for the GNU operating system, which was written to be a free (libre) replacement for UNIX. 

Since the late 1990s, it has been included as part of a large number of operating system distributions, many of which are commonly also called Linux. However, there is a controversy surrounding the naming of such systems; some people, including Richard Stallman, argue calling such systems "Linux" is erroneous because the operating system is actually mostly GNU, with the Linux kernel being one component added later on in 1992, nine years after the initiation of the GNU project in 1983, hence the name "GNU+Linux" or "GNU/Linux" should be used instead. 


### GNU Project

The GNU Project is a free software, mass collaboration project that Richard Stallman announced on September 27, 1983. Its goal is to give computer users freedom and control in their use of their computers and computing devices by collaboratively developing and publishing software that gives everyone the rights to freely run the software, copy and distribute it, study it, and modify it. GNU software grants these rights in its license.
