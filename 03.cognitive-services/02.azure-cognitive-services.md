## Azure

### Core Concepts

In the following we will introduce some key concepts of Azure.
In the [references section](#references) you can find the links to the official Microsoft documentation with screenshots and samples.

#### Resource Group

A resource group is a container that holds related resources for an Azure solution.
The resource group can include all the resources for the solution, or only those resources that you want to manage as a group.
You decide how you want to allocate resources to resource groups based on what makes the most sense for your organization.
Generally, add resources that share the same lifecycle to the same resource group so you can easily deploy, update, and delete them as a group.

#### Resource

A resource is a manageable item that is available through Azure.
Virtual machines, storage accounts, web apps, databases, and virtual networks are examples of resources.
Resource groups, subscriptions, management groups, and tags are also examples of resources.

#### Tags

You apply tags to your Azure resources, resource groups, and subscriptions to logically organize them into a taxonomy.
Each tag consists of a *name and a value pair*.
For example, you can apply the name "Environment" and the value "Production" to all the resources in production.

### CLI

The Azure command-line interface (Azure CLI) is a set of commands used to create and manage Azure resources.
The Azure CLI is available across Azure services and is designed to get you working quickly with Azure, with an emphasis on automation.

The Azure CLI is available to install in Windows, macOS and Linux environments.
It can also be run in a Docker container and Azure Cloud Shell.

## What are Azure Cognitive Services

*Azure Cognitive Services* are APIs, SDKs, and services available to help developers build intelligent applications without having direct AI or data science skills or knowledge.
Azure Cognitive Services enable developers to easily add cognitive features into their applications.
The goal of Azure Cognitive Services is to help developers create applications that can see, hear, speak, understand, and even begin to reason.
The *catalog* of services within Azure Cognitive Services can be categorized into four main pillars - *Vision, Speech, Language and Decision*.

### SDKs and API Specification

Most packages in the SDKs are generated from [Azure API specs](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs) using [Azure/autorest](https://github.com/Azure/autorest).

The SDK codebase adheres to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) and thus avoids breaking changes other than at major (x.0.0) releases.
Because Azure's APIs are updated frequently, Microsoft releases a new major version at the end of each month with a full changelog.
For more details and background see [SDK Update Practices](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/wiki/SDK-Update-Practices).

On Github it is also possible to find the repositories of the implementations of the azure sdks for different languages.
To obtain this list of repos you can go to the [Azure Github account page](https://github.com/Azure) and query the list of repositories for "[azure-sdk-for](https://github.com/Azure?q=azure-sdk-for&type=&language=)".
