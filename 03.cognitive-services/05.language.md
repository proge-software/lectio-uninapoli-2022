## Introduction

Analyzing text is a process where you evaluate different aspects of a document or phrase, in order to gain insights into the content of that text, such as the general meaning, the language or the sentiment of the person who wrote the text.

It is a very important field of Artificial Intelligence, and at the same time one of the most challenging.

As an example, suppose you want to get the language of the following sentence:
_The croque monsieur avec frites was terrific. Bon appetit!_

A human would rely on their own experiences and knowledge to understand that English is the main language, as "Croque monsieur avec frites" is just the name of a Dish, and "Bon Appetit!" is just a funny sentence ending as the plate was french. Developing an algorithm that correctly solves this kind of problems is not an easy task.

Text analytics has many possible applications, such as:
* A way to understand the request of a client in a ChatBot
* A social media feed analyzer to detect sentiment around a political campaign or a product in market.
* A document search application that extracts key phrases to help summarize the main subject matter of documents in a catalog.
* A tool to extract brand information or company names from documents or other text for identification purposes.

Azure provides several cloud-based API services that provides advanced natural language processing over raw text, with zero or few configuration needed:
* The *Language service*, which includes four main functions: sentiment analysis, key phrase extraction, language detection, and named entity recognition.
* *Conversational Language Understanding*, a tool to predict overall meaning of a sentence, and pull out relevant, detailed information, typically used as support for a ChatBot.
* The *Translator service*, which supports text-to-text translation.
* The *Speech service*, which enables speech-to-text and speech-to-speech translation.

In our course we will focus on the first two tools.

## Language Service

The Language service is a part of the Azure Cognitive Services offerings that can perform advanced natural language processing over raw text.

### Sentiment Analysis

Use [sentiment analysis](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/text-analytics/how-tos/text-analytics-how-to-sentiment-analysis) to find out what customers think of your brand or topic by analyzing raw text for clues about positive or negative sentiment. 
This API returns a sentiment score between 0 and 1 for each document, where 1 is the most positive.
The analysis models are pretrained using an extensive body of text and natural language technologies from Microsoft.
For [selected languages](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/text-analytics/text-analytics-supported-languages), the API can analyze and score any raw text that you provide, directly returning results to the calling application.

### Key Phrase Extraction

Automatically [extract key phrases](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/text-analytics/how-tos/text-analytics-how-to-keyword-extraction) to quickly identify the main points.
For example, for the input text "The food was delicious and there were wonderful staff", the API returns the main talking points: "food" and "wonderful staff".

### Language Detection

You can [detect which language the input text is written in](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/text-analytics/how-tos/text-analytics-how-to-language-detection) and report a single language code for every document submitted on the request in a wide range of languages, variants, dialects, and some regional/cultural languages.
The language code is paired with a score indicating the strength of the score.

### Named Entity Recognition

[Identify and categorize entities](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/text-analytics/how-tos/text-analytics-how-to-entity-linking) in your text as people, places, organizations, date/time, quantities, percentages, currencies, and more. Well-known entities are also recognized and linked to more information on the web.

### Question&Answering

Question answering provides cloud-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) that allows you to create a natural conversational layer over your data. It is used to find the most appropriate answer for any input from your custom knowledge base (KB) of information.

Question answering is commonly used to build conversational client applications, which include social media applications, chat bots, and speech-enabled desktop applications. Several new features have been added including enhanced relevance using a deep learning ranker, precise answers, and end-to-end region support.

Question answering comprises of two capabilities:

* Custom question answering: Using this capability users can customize different aspects like edit question and answer pairs extracted from the content source, define synonyms and metadata, accept question suggestions etc.
* Prebuilt question answering: This capability allows users to get a response by querying a text passage without having the need to manage knowledgebases.

## Conversational Language Understanding

CLU is a tool that takes as input a user sentence (called utterrance), and outputs the main intent of the user, together with some relevant informations (entities). A common client application for LUIS is a chat bot.

Take for instance the following sentence: Turn on the light in the kitchen
CLU may detect that the main intent of the user is to "turn on" a device, and entities are light (type of device) and kithcen (place). 

A ChatBot application may query CLU to get the main intent and devices, it then should apply its own logic to fulfill the requested actions, and give a proper response: CLU is not conceived to provide answers to the user.

CLU must be configured for your specific application: you can use prebuilt domains that include intents and entities for common scenarios, or define your own. 

### Configure CLU

In order to configure CLU for your application, you will need to provide:
* A list of intents, each with a list of example utterrances, that the algorithm will use to train a machine learning model
* A list of entity types, configurable in different ways:
	* *List*: simply provide a list of all entities, each with possible synonyms. E.g: light (synonym lamp), washing machine,â€¦
	* *RegEx*: provide regular expressions to extract entities such as telephone numbers
	* *Machine-Learned*: provide example of entities in your example utterrances, the model will be trained to detect them
![small](images/ml-entities.png)


	* *Pattern.any*: define custom patterns to extract entities
 
More complex entities (with hierarchy and structures) may be defined, we will not provide details here.

Configuration may be adjusted even after model is in production, by adding some of the user provided utterrances as new training utterrances.
