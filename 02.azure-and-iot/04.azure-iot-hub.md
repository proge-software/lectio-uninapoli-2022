### Device-to-Cloud communication

When sending information from the device app to the solution back end, IoT Hub exposes three options:

- **Device-to-cloud messages** for time series telemetry and alerts.
- **Device twin**'s reported properties for reporting device state information such as available capabilities, conditions, or the state of long-running workflows. For example, configuration and software updates.
- **File uploads** for media files and large telemetry batches uploaded by intermittently connected devices or compressed to save bandwidth.

| Factor                | Device-to-cloud messages                                                                                                             | Device twin's reported properties                                                                                                                                                                    | File uploads                                                                                                                        |

### Cloud-to-Device communication

IoT Hub provides three options for device apps to expose functionality to a back-end app:

- [Direct methods](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-direct-methods) for communications that require immediate confirmation of the result. Direct methods are often used for interactive control of devices such as turning on a fan.

- [Twin's desired properties](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-device-twins) for long-running commands intended to put the device into a certain desired state. For example, set the telemetry send interval to 30 minutes.

- [Cloud-to-device messages](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-messages-c2d) for one-way notifications to the device app.

Here is a detailed comparison of the various cloud-to-device communication options.

#### Direct methods

IoT Hub gives you the ability to invoke direct methods on devices from the cloud.
Direct methods represent a request-reply interaction with a device similar to an HTTP call in that they succeed or fail immediately (after a user-specified timeout).
This approach is useful for scenarios where the course of immediate action is different depending on whether the device was able to respond.

### Device Twins

A device twin is a JSON document that includes:

- **Tags**. A section of the JSON document that the solution back end can read from and write to. Tags are not visible to device apps.
- **Desired properties**. Used along with reported properties to synchronize device configuration or conditions. The solution back end can set desired properties, and the device app can read them. The device app can also receive notifications of changes in the desired properties.
- **Reported properties**. Used along with desired properties to synchronize device configuration or conditions. The device app can set reported properties, and the solution back end can read and query them.
- **Device identity properties**. The root of the device twin JSON document contains the read-only properties from the corresponding device identity stored in the identity registry. Properties connectionStateUpdatedTime and generationId will not be included.

![image](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/media/iot-hub-devguide-device-twins/twin.png)

Azure IoT Hub maintains a device twin for each device that you connect to IoT Hub.

Use device twins to:

- Store device-specific metadata in the cloud. For example, the deployment location of a vending machine.
- Report current state information such as available capabilities and conditions from your device app. For example, whether a device is connected to your IoT hub over cellular or WiFi.
- Synchronize the state of long-running workflows between device app and back-end app. For example, when the solution back end specifies the new firmware version to install, and the device app reports the various stages of the update process.
- Query your device metadata, configuration, or state.

#### Reported Properties Example

Reported properties simplify scenarios where the solution back end is interested in the last known value of a property.

#### Desired properties Example

1. The solution back end sets the desired property with the desired configuration value.

   ```json
   "desired": {
       "telemetryConfig": {
           "sendFrequency": "5m"
       },
       ...
   },
   ```

2. The device app is notified of the change immediately if the device is connected. If it's not connected, the device app follows the device [reconnection flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-device-twins#device-reconnection-flow) when it connects. The device app then reports the updated configuration (or an error condition using the status property). Here is the portion of the reported properties:

   ```json
   "reported": {
       "telemetryConfig": {
           "sendFrequency": "5m",
           "status": "success"
       }
       ...
   }
   ```

3. The solution back end can track the results of the configuration operation across many devices by querying device twins.

You can use twins to synchronize long-running operations such as firmware updates.

#### Back-end operations

The solution back end operates on the device twin using the following atomic operations, exposed through HTTPS:

1. **Retrieve device twin by ID**. This operation returns the device twin document, including tags and desired and reported system properties.
2. **Partially update device twin**. This operation enables the solution back end to partially update the tags or desired properties in a device twin. The partial update is expressed as a JSON document that adds or updates any property. Properties set to null are removed.
3. **Replace desired properties**. This operation enables the solution back end to completely overwrite all existing desired properties and substitute a new JSON document for properties/desired.
4. **Replace tags**. This operation enables the solution back end to completely overwrite all existing tags and substitute a new JSON document for tags.
5. **Receive twin notifications**. This operation allows the solution back end to be notified when the twin is modified. To do so, your IoT solution needs to create a route and to set the Data Source equal to twinChangeEvents. By default, no such routes pre-exist, so no twin notifications are sent. If the rate of change is too high, or for other reasons such as internal failures, the IoT Hub might send only one notification that contains all changes. Therefore, if your application needs reliable auditing and logging of all intermediate states, you should use device-to-cloud messages.

#### Device operations

The device app operates on the device twin using the following atomic operations:

- **Retrieve device twin**. This operation returns the device twin document (including desired and reported system properties) for the currently connected device. (Tags are not visible to device apps.)
- **Partially update reported properties**. This operation enables the partial update of the reported properties of the currently connected device. This operation uses the same JSON update format that the solution back end uses for a partial update of desired properties.
- **Observe desired properties**. The currently connected device can choose to be notified of updates to the desired properties when they happen. The device receives the same form of update (partial or full replacement) executed by the solution back end.
