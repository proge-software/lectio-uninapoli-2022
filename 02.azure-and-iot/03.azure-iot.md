## Azure IoT Hub

Azure IoT Hub is a managed service hosted in the cloud that acts as a central message hub for communication between an IoT application and its attached devices.
You can connect millions of devices and their backend solutions reliably and securely.
Almost any device can be connected to an IoT hub.

Several messaging patterns are supported, including device-to-cloud telemetry, uploading files from devices, and request-reply methods to control your devices from the cloud.
IoT Hub also supports monitoring to help you track device creation, device connections, and device failures.

## Azure IoT Hub Edge

Azure IoT Edge moves cloud analytics and custom business logic to devices so that your organization can focus on business insights instead of data management.
Scale out your IoT solution by packaging your business logic into standard containers, then you can deploy those containers to any of your devices and monitor it all from the cloud.

Analytics drives business value in IoT solutions, but not all analytics needs to be in the cloud.
If you want to respond to emergencies as quickly as possible, you can run anomaly detection workloads at the edge.
If you want to reduce bandwidth costs and avoid transferring terabytes of raw data, you can clean and aggregate the data locally then only send the insights to the cloud for analysis.

Azure IoT Edge is made up of three components:

- IoT Edge modules are containers that run Azure services, third-party services, or your own code. Modules are deployed to IoT Edge devices and execute locally on those devices.
- The IoT Edge runtime runs on each IoT Edge device and manages the modules deployed to each device.
- A cloud-based interface enables you to remotely monitor and manage IoT Edge devices.

## Azure Digital Twins

Azure Digital Twins is a platform as a service (PaaS) offering that enables the creation of twin graphs based on digital models of entire environments, which could be buildings, factories, farms, energy networks, railways, stadiums, and moreâ€”even entire cities.
These digital models can be used to gain insights that drive better products, optimized operations, reduced costs, and breakthrough customer experiences.

Azure Digital Twins can be used to design a digital twin architecture that represents actual IoT devices in a wider cloud solution, and which connects to IoT Hub device twins to send and receive live data.

> IoT Hub device twins are different from Azure Digital Twins digital twins.
> While IoT Hub device twins are maintained by your IoT hub for each IoT device that you connect to it, digital twins in Azure Digital Twins can be representations of anything defined by digital models and instantiated within Azure Digital Twins.

## Azure IoT Central

IoT Central is an IoT [application platform as a service (aPaaS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-fundamentals/iot-solution-apaas-paas) that reduces the burden and cost of developing, managing, and maintaining enterprise-grade IoT solutions.
If you choose to build with IoT Central, you'll have the opportunity to focus time, money, and energy on transforming your business with IoT data, rather than just maintaining and updating a complex and continually evolving IoT infrastructure.

The web UI lets you quickly connect devices, monitor device conditions, create rules, and manage millions of devices and their data throughout their life cycle.
Furthermore, it enables you to act on device insights by extending IoT intelligence into line-of-business applications.

## Azure Sphere

Azure Sphere is a secured, high-level application platform with built-in communication and security features for internet-connected devices.
It comprises a secured, connected, crossover microcontroller unit (MCU), a custom high-level Linux-based operating system (OS), and a cloud-based security service that provides continuous, renewable security.

The Azure Sphere MCU integrates real-time processing capabilities with the ability to run a high-level operating system.
An Azure Sphere MCU, along with its operating system and application platform, enables the creation of secured, internet-connected devices that can be updated, controlled, monitored, and maintained remotely. A connected device that includes an Azure Sphere MCU, either alongside or in place of an existing MCU(s), provides enhanced security, productivity, and opportunity

The Azure Sphere Security Service is an integral aspect of Azure Sphere.
Using this service, Azure Sphere MCUs safely and securely connect to the cloud and web.
The service ensures that the device boots only with an authorized version of genuine, approved software.
In addition, it provides a secured channel through which Microsoft can automatically download and install OS updates to deployed devices in the field to mitigate security problems.
Neither manufacturer nor end-user intervention is required, thus closing a common security hole.

### Hardware architecture

An Azure Sphere crossover MCU consists of multiple cores on a single die, as the following figure shows.

Each core, and its associated subsystem, is in a different trust domain.
The root of trust resides in the Pluton security subsystem.
Each layer of the architecture assumes that the layer above it may be compromised.
Within each layer, resource isolation and dynamic compartments provide added security.

## Azure RTOS

Azure RTOS is a real time operating system (RTOS) for Internet of Things (IoT) and edge devices powered by microcontroller units (MCUs).
Azure RTOS is designed to support most highly constrained devices (battery powered and having less than 64 KB of flash memory).

Azure RTOS is pre-certified for a variety of safety standards.
These include the IEC 61508 SIL 4, IEC 62304 Class C, and ISO 26262 ASIL D certifications.

Azure RTOS provides an EAL4+ Common Criteria security certified environment, including full IP layer security via IPsec and socket layer security via TLS and DTLS.
Our software crypto library has achieved FIPS 140-2 certification.
We also leverage hardware cryptographic capabilities, memory protection via ThreadX MODULES, and support for ARM's TrustZone ARMv8-M security features.
